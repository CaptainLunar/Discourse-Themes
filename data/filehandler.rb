#Ideas
#This will allow the user to save CSS files on the server side.
#After we have saved a CSS file on the server side, the file will be available for all clients including admins/users
#Then, if a user picks a css theme we can save it in their browser using HTML5 localStorage


#TODO
#Create File handling class. Save everything admin uploads in CSS-Files.
#Only the admin can add CSS files to the plugin.
#Users can only see the files and now directly modify in any ways
#Users can only get a copy saved in their localStorage
#If user changes themes, it will override their settings in localStorage
